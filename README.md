# SI507_FinalProject
Repo for final project

I plan to conduct an analysis of President Donald Trump's twitter usage. I will run a basic sentiment analysis using an open source sentiment analyzer package, such as TextBlob. Similarly, I will analyze who Trump most frequently mentions in his tweets. Time permitting, I will also see if there is any basic correlation between Trump's tweets retweet count and their sentiment score. 

### Part 0: Get Data from Twitter
- [ ] Review Twitter API documentation
- [ ] Set up cache system
- [ ] Write code to fetch Trump's tweets (from cache or from API)
- [ ] Parse relevant data points from returned json structure

### Part 1: Build Class
- [ ] Design class to process twitter responses
- [ ] Focus on returning tweet content, date, retweet count, and mentions, along with sentiment score and sentiment determination

### Part 2: Migrate to SQL
- [ ] Build code to create database structure for 2 tables (twitter data and sentiment scores)
- [ ] Populate tables based on data updated from class

### Part 3: Visualize Data
- [ ] Use plotly or other package to visualize Trump's sentiment scores over time
- [ ] Use plotly to visualize top mentions from his tweets

### Part 4: Test methods
- [ ] Write 15+ test methods to ensure code works properly!
